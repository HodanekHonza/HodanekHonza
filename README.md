## About Me

I am a backend-focused **Java developer** with hands-on experience in both production and personal projects.  
My main expertise lies in **Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA)**, where I design clean, maintainable, and scalable systems following **SOLID, DRY, and KISS** principles.

In my professional work, I contributed to the **New Transparency Project. Client: ENTSO-E**, migrating core functionality from **Java 8 to Java 17/21** and designing **data processing pipelines** (data transformation, validation, and integration).

Alongside this, I have built personal projects such as **Salonio**, a modular monolith system with booking, availability, notifications, payments, and staff management, showcasing **event-driven architecture** and modular reuse.

I am currently expanding my skills with **Go**, focusing on performant, concurrent backend development.
