## About Me

I’m a software development student with a strong focus on **Java**. Currently, I work at **Unicorn**, where I am involved in a data processing project for **ENTSOE**. My role primarily includes implementing features for improved data processing and fixing bugs.

### Tech Stack:
- **Primary Language:** Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate)
- **Backend:** Go (Learning), Node.js
- **Frontend (experience but not primary):** React
- **Tools & Platforms:** IntelliJ IDEA, Git, Docker
