## About Me

I am a backend-focused Java developer with hands-on experience building **modular monolith systems** and robust backend architectures. My main expertise is in **Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA)**, designing clean and maintainable systems, and working with **event-driven architectures**.

I have worked on projects involving **booking systems, availability management, notifications, payments**, and **large-scale data processing**, applying clean code principles like **SOLID, DRY, and KISS**. While I have frontend experience with React, my focus and passion lie in **backend development**.

I am expanding my skill set with **Go** to explore performant, concurrent backend systems and further improve my architecture and design capabilities.
